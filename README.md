# Make Solution

Once upon a time I was working on a project and decided to put it on GitHub. Since the code here is not very good, I decided to clean it somehow. This is definitely not for community, but you can take some PHP techniques here, for example, registration and logim system with [RedBeanPHP](https://www.redbeanphp.com/index.php).

## Usage

I deployed it to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

> Actually, project doesn't work now
